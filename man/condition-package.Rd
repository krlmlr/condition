\title{Create custom conditions}
\description{
R has a condition system, but misses basic functions for
creating condition objects and checking inheritance. (No,
\code{structure()} and \code{inherits()} don't count.) The functions and
classes in this package allow the simple creation of custom
condition objects and even the definition of own condition
class hierarchies.

See for example \code{\link{new_error}}, or the corresponding R6 class
\code{\link{Error}}.
